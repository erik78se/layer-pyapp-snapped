# Tutorial: Charms with layer-snap

Difficulty: Intermediate
Author: [Erik LÃ¶nroth](http://eriklonroth.com)

## Warning: Work In Progress
This tutorial is in the making, feel to test and help me to improve it.

Note! Currently, [layer-snap] also need patching. I have made a PR to make this all work nicely. See: https://github.com/stub42/layer-snap/pull/19  @stub  *hint*

All code for the charm can be found here: https://github.com/erik78se/layer-pyapp-snapped

## Preparations
1. You should have completed the first beginner tutorial [Part 1], [Part 2], [Part 3] before taking this tutorial. 
2. Use juju 2.4 or greater.
3. charm-tools 2.4.4 or above or builds will fail.

Its good if you know how to create your own SNAP, but its not needed. [You can learn SNAP:ing here].

## What you will learn
* Understand why [SNAP:s] are useful in a JUJU context.
* Create a simple juju charm with "[layer-snap]"

## Why juju charms + SNAP ?
SNAP packages are _universal to Linux_. This means that we can deploy our snapped applications without having to re-package for every linux distribution our users prefer, like ubuntu, debian, raspbian, NI Linux Real-Time distribution or centos. Great news for every DevOps team!

A specifically interesting use-case of [SNAP:s] are for "IoT applications". The reasons for that are: 

1. SNAPs do atomic upgrades.
2. SNAPs are OS agnostic.
3. SNAPs has a very secure confinement.
4. SNAPs can be made very independent of its execution environment.

Using JUJU for development and deployment of IoT SNAPs will get your IoT applications ready for the world! 

## The "pyapp" SNAP
We will use a training SNAP I have created for us: [pyapp]. The pyapp application is a python3 application that writes a simple message to stdout and loggs a few messages to syslog.

The code for [pyapp] is available here: [snap-pyapp]

We can easily install it to test it:
```bash
sudo snap install pyapp --devmode
pyapp.run
```

## Create a new charm & include "layer-snap".
I called my charm "pyapp-snapped" (Recall from earlier tutorials that the layer- prefix is to indicate this is a reactive charm.) Feel free to use a cooler name for yours if you like.

```bash
snapcaft create layer-pyapp-snapped
```
## Create your **layer.yaml** and modify the repo value as needed. 

_Pay some attention to that we are in fact installing two snaps here. "core" and "snap". The reason for pulling in the "core" snap is that there seems to be a bug that occasionally leaves out this. I think this might go away in the future. For now, see it as a bonus._
 
```yaml
includes:
  - 'layer:basic'
  - 'layer:snap'
options:
  snap:
    core:
      channel: stable
      devmode: false
      jailmode: false
      dangerous: false
      classic: false
      revision: null
    pyapp:
      channel: edge
      devmode: true
      jailmode: false
      dangerous: false
      classic: false
      revision: null
repo: 'https://github.com/erik78se/layer-pyapp-snapped'
```
## Create your **metadata.yaml**

```yaml
name: pyapp-snapped
display-name: pyapp-snapped
summary: Simple charm for the pyapp snap
maintainer: Erik Lonroth <erik.lonroth@gmail.com>
description: |
  This charm deploys the pyapp  application, either from snapstore or if you supply it as a juju resource.
tags:
  - example
  - snap
  - pyapp
series:
  - bionic
resources:
  pyapp-snap:
    type: file
    filename: pyapp.snap
    description: A pyapp snap
```
What we notice here, is the included [charm-resource]. This makes the [layer-snap] aware that we _may_ attach a package along with our deployment (It will be uploaded to the juju controller who then distributes it). We won't do this in this tutorial, but feel free to try it on your own.  

The resource is just going to be a placeholder in this case. [layer-snap] will automatically download our snap from snapstore.io if it is not uploaded to the controller along with the deploy.


## Create the **reactive/layer_pyapp_snapped.py**
```yaml
from charmhelpers.core.hookenv import (
    open_port,
    status_set,
)
from charmhelpers.core.hookenv import application_version_set
from charms.reactive import (
    when,when_not,
    set_flag,clear_flag
)
from charms.layer import snap

@when('snap.installed.pyapp')
def set_pyapp_snapped_available():
    """
    When snap is installed, just keep on updating.
    """
    version = snap.get_installed_version('pyapp')
    channel = snap.get_installed_channel('pyapp')
    application_version_set(version)
    status_set('active', "Ready pyapp-{} ({})".format(version,channel))
    set_flag('my.pyapp.application.available')

@when_not('snap.installed.pyapp')
def pyapp_not_installed():
    """
    Whenever the snap is not installed, clear statuses and flags.
    """
    application_version_set("")
    clear_flag('my.pyapp.application.available')
    status_set('waiting', "Pyapp snap not installed.")
```

## Proof, Build and Deploy
```bash
charm proof
charm build
```
Deploy from our local build.
```bash
juju deploy /home/erik/charms/builds/pyapp-snapped
Deploying charm "local:bionic/pyapp-snapped-0".
```

## Test it
Lets see if the snap was installed and works.
```bash
juju ssh pyapp-snapped/0 /snap/bin/pyapp.run
```

Great! You have just created a juju charm that deploys a snap!

## Next lesson
Next we will learn to add in a [juju-action] and relate our charm to a logging and search facility - the [ELK] (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack.
